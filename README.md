This is a Scholarship Information system, it is designed to provide scholarship information and assistance to users. Here's an overview of how the system would work:

- ✔ Search for Scholarships: Users can search for scholarships using various criteria such as age, gender, current study, income, category, state, district, and first graduate status. This allows users to find scholarships that are specifically relevant to their circumstances.

- ✔ Profile Filtering and Editing: Users have the ability to filter scholarship results based on their own profile information. They can also edit their profile details to ensure accurate and up-to-date filtering.

- ✔ Search for Scholarships for Others: Users can search for scholarships not only for themselves but also for others. This feature enables users to assist their peers or family members in finding suitable scholarships.

- ✔ Admin Panel: Administrators have access to an admin panel where they can add new scholarships to the system. This ensures that the scholarship database is regularly updated with the latest opportunities.

- ✔Personalized Notifications: The system sends personalized notifications to registered users. Users receive notifications when new scholarships matching their profile are added to the system. They are also notified when scholarship deadlines are approaching to prevent them from missing out on application opportunities.

Overall, Scholli aims to simplify the scholarship search process by providing users with a comprehensive platform to find

1. Relevant scholarships,

2. Customize search filters,

3. Manage profiles, and

4. Receive timely notifications about new opportunities and approaching deadlines.
